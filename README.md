 With Rust or Zig, whenever possible i like to put the entire app in one file. That way it is super easy to run, feed to Ai to update, audit or edit, or make modifications to. The majority of git repos contain absurdly bloated apps with way too many files. When Ai allows one to upload an entire bloated repo at once, it will not be so much of an issue. For now, if any repo is too bloated to feed to ai- then the repo should me marked as dangerous and not used. It is not 1920 any more. You do not have to run bloated malware apps.
