# Codebase Superior Design

MVC pattern is something they teach to new coders to keep them busy with stupidity.  With Rust or Zig, whenever possible i like to put the entire app in one file. That way it is super easy to run, feed to Ai to update, audit or edit, or make modifications to. The majority of git repos contain absurdly bloated apps with way too many files. When Ai allows one to upload an entire bloated repo at once, it will not be so much of an issue. For now, if any repo is too bloated to feed to ai- then the repo should be marked as dangerous and not used. The extreme bloat in most repos is just silly. 

 Objectively, Rust is god (for today). That will change when ai draws on rust's years of dev as a starting point and produces a superior lang. Then, Rust will be laughable like the rest. If you are not coding in the current god lang- or even the top 3-, you are missing the entire point of coding. 




 Zig is okay as long as it is a single file app that Ai can audit. Zig dev is light years behind rust tho - and the 4 person zig dev team may enjoy the bloated paychecks from your "nonprofit"- but that is not how to grow and dev a lang. Literally, almost every nonprofit is a laughable scam. Nevertheless, one can compile a single page of zig code to a very powerful app. So i f-w zig maybe about 5 percent of my time, just for fun. 


# Code Of Misconduct 

Let’s be real: the folks inventing Codes of Conduct are the ultimate control freaks—clearly harboring some serious personal issues if they need to regulate every interaction as if they’re running a preschool. These lunatics seem to think adult developers can’t handle a stray swear or a questionable joke without a permission slip. Enough with the power trip; we’re here to write code, not color inside someone’s arbitrary lines.


Rust and Zig strutting around like hall monitors with their shiny new Codes of Conduct—what is this, recess? Last I checked, we weren’t finger-painting or trading snacks; we’re grown adults who can handle a stray swear or two without a teacher swooping in with a red pen. If you’re writing compilers instead of coloring inside the lines, you probably don’t need a permission slip for “Be Nice™” taped to your README. So next time someone asks you to RSVP to the etiquette committee before pushing code, just smile, drop that COC folder in the trash, and get back to actual programming—no timeout required.

# Final Words

Let your code speak for itself. Make the best dam app possible- no bs, no bloat. The days of clowns answering questions with rude answers on stack overflow are gone forever! Why post a question to stack overflow when Ai can give you an instant answer? Why waste hours of time on a prime/theo/bash video that literally makes you stupider, goes in circles and is a crime against humanity? You could get more from a 2 minute session with Ai. Except @lauriewired tho, she is my fave and always puts her entire heart into her videos.
