Rust is the undisputed champ right now, and no amount of flashy YouTube vids hyping the latest trendy language will change that. Those clickbait cycles are a waste of brain cells. I’d love to see a language outdo Rust’s memory safety and reliability, but that’s a job for AI in the future. For now, Rust’s years of grind, massive funding, and undeniable edge stand tall. Instead of whining about Rust’s popularity, maybe the naysayers should figure out why it’s so damn loved.

Oh, and spare me the “code of conduct” nonsense for languages. It’s not a kindergarten class—grown-ups should have enough sense to act right. Some folks just get a kick out of controlling others, slapping pointless rules on a language to flex their virtue. Lame.

So, quick wrap: Rust rules for now, Zig’s got potential, and AI codes my Rust and Zig repos.
