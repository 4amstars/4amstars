Today, for now, Rust is the objective god. It does not matter what the prime/theo clickbait vid touting the lang of the week says. Such content goes in circles and makes you stupider while wasting your time. I would love to see a lang even more memory safe and even more reliable than Rust. Ai will be able to make a superior lang in the future- but for now the years of dev, millions of dollars invested and concrete, clear superiority of Rust stands on its own merit and speaks for itself. Instead of content clowns constantly complaining about how much people like Rust, maybe the clowns should ask themselves why Rust is so liked.

Zig is interesting. I am ALWAYS skeptical of any non-profit-, as so many are scams. The obvious scam is to hype a cause, make a huge salary to live off while supposedly doing "non-profit" work. Moreover, the money gained from the scam is laundered and used for personal gain. Zig staying so small "the team of 4" on purpose for years is a clear indication of playing the system. How do you expect Zig to catch up to all the dev that Rust took years to evolve to? And even then- zig will still not be as memory safe. Yet, for all of my skeptical insights, Zig is still interesting. I like the low overhead very much- a no nonsense approach. Installing any lang should be that easy. And i must admit- a one page zig file can compile to an incredibly powerful executable. If zig ever stops wanting to be a team of 4 and honestly wants to grow- well, it would seem less like a pump and dump crypto scam and more like a serious endeavor.

Ai will one day draw upon all the toiling of years of lang dev. It will one day make a lang that is out of the box superior to anything we have so far. It will be a great day, and the new lang will be worth learning. Till then, i do not bother learning Rust or Zig- because my standards are higher than what both currently offer. Besides, Ai can make decent apps in either lang.

Lastly, no one needs a code of conduct for a lang. Common sense should prevail. People seem to get off by control of other people- for example making silly code of conduct for a lang in order to virtue signal. Third grade school children benefit from a code of conduct so they can learn to function in society. Langs are not a third grade classroom.
