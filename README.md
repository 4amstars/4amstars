There are lots of apps here that Ai made, simple, one page code base. Rust and Zig. 

I bounce from linux to windows but due to this video https://youtu.be/bWXmDvKU1Ww?feature=shared by djware  im not going to mess with linux for a while. A long while.

It really sucks that no one gives a crap bout personal sites any more, (so only delusional people try to make websites lol) but at least Ai stepped in to fill the very real void. Ai is
exciting and empowering. Learning to code is laughable- just have ai make your apps in any lang.
