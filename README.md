Today, for now, Rust is the objective god. It does not matter what the prime/theo clickbait vid touting the lang of the week says. Such content goes in circles and makes you stupider while wasting your time. I would love to see a lang even more memory safe and even more reliable than Rust. Ai will be able to make a superior lang in the future- but for now the years of dev, millions of dollars invested and concrete, clear superiority of Rust stands on its own merit and speaks for itself.
