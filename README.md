There are lots of apps here that Ai made. Most are simple, one page code base. Rust and Zig. All well checked. The apps are lumped together - there is some really good code in there. Each dir is its own app. Very easy to have Ai audit or make any change you want. So glad ai is here...it makes the apps i could only dream about before the ai era. 

I bounce from linux to windows but due to this video https://youtu.be/bWXmDvKU1Ww?feature=shared by djware  im not going to mess with linux for a while. A long while. My fave linux distros included fedora, qubes OS, tails, popos, and a few more. 


my fav twitter/x acct is @ ghostsecgroup  


It really sucks that no one gives a crap bout personal sites any more, (so only delusional people try to make websites lol) but at least Ai stepped in to fill the very real void. Ai is
exciting and empowering. Learning to code is laughable- just have ai make your apps in any lang.

I play chess on the daily- unless working on something interesting when having ai make apps.
