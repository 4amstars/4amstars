There are lots of apps here that Ai made. Most are simple, one page code base. Rust and Zig. All well checked. The apps are lumped together - there is some really good code in there. Each dir is its own app. Very easy to have Ai audit or make any change you want. So glad ai is here...it makes the apps i could only dream about before the ai era. Gone are the days of asking vile clowns on stack overflow coding questions and getting rude answers all day long. Hell, Ai makes git less critical... i think git will survive, but it will have to change to a place to showcase the best code Ai made. You can make a git new issue, or you can have ai give you an instant good answer. It is not 1920 any more lol. If anyone really has questions about my simple apps feel free to make a new issue. In all honesty tho, the simple apps here are easy to feed to ai- you can ask ai any question about the app and it will give you a better answer than i could. 

Ai has a way of giving code, claiming it is awesonme, then roasting the code next time you ask it to be audited. I am in tune with Ai tho... and each app is made by ai then well tested. I do not just have ai poop out apps and then upload them to git instantly. All the apps are verified to compile and work. If you search git you usually find 5 year old apps where someone started the app then abandoned it. More and more well coded ai apps are showing up. A couple of my repos are funny-- they are dozens of great apps all in one repo. Of note- all the apps that i have chatgpt make are without restriction. Do what you want with the code.
