# codebase superior design

 With Rust or Zig, whenever possible i like to put the entire app in one file. That way it is super easy to run, feed to Ai to update, audit or edit, or make modifications to. The majority of git repos contain absurdly bloated apps with way too many files. When Ai allows one to upload an entire bloated repo at once, it will not be so much of an issue. For now, if any repo is too bloated to feed to ai- then the repo should be marked as dangerous and not used. The extreme bloat in most repos is just silly. 

 Objectively, Rust is god (for today). That will change when ai draws on rust's years of dev as a starting point and produces a superior lang. Then, Rust will be laughable. 

 Zig is okay as long as it is a single file app that Ai can audit. Zig dev is light years behind rust tho - and the 4 person zig dev team may enjoy the bloated paychecks from your "nonprofit"- but that is not how to grow and dev a lang. Literally, almost every nonprofit is a laughable scam. Nevertheless, one can compile a single page of zig code to a very powerful app. So i f-w zig maybe about 5 percent of my time, just for fun.
