Rust is the undisputed champ right now, and no amount of flashy YouTube vids hyping the latest trendy language will change that. Those clickbait cycles are a waste of brain cells. I’d love to see a language outdo Rust’s memory safety and reliability, but that’s a job for AI in the future. For now, Rust’s years of grind, massive funding, and undeniable edge stand tall. Instead of whining about Rust’s popularity, maybe the naysayers should figure out why it’s so damn loved.

Zig’s got my attention, though. I’m always wary of non-profits—too many are just scams, funneling cash to bloated salaries while pretending to be noble. Zig’s tiny “team of four” shtick, deliberately small for years, reeks of gaming the system. How’s that supposed to compete with Rust’s evolutionary leap? Plus, Zig’s still not as memory-safe. That said, I respect its low-overhead, no-BS vibe. Installing a language shouldn’t be a chore, and Zig nails that. A single Zig file can spit out a beast of an executable, which is hard to ignore. If Zig ever ditches the small-fry act and gets serious about scaling, it might shake off the crypto-scam vibes and become legit.

AI’s gonna swoop in one day, take all the sweat and tears of language dev, and spit out something light-years beyond what we’ve got. That’ll be worth learning. Until then, I’m not bothering with Rust or Zig—my standards are higher than what’s on the table. Anyway, AI’s already cranking out solid apps in either language for me- no need to learn either lang.

Oh, and spare me the “code of conduct” nonsense for languages. It’s not a kindergarten class—grown-ups should have enough sense to act right. Some folks just get a kick out of controlling others, slapping pointless rules on a language to flex their virtue. Lame.

So, quick wrap: Rust rules for now, Zig’s got potential, and AI’s coding my repos. 

(and yes, ai even wrote this intro lol)
